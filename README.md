Description
My game uses the sound sensor to change colors and add points to the game depending on 
the given threshold. The louder a person is, the more points they will get. The objective is to get 
to 100 points quickly. Once 100 points is met, then the game is over.

User Input/Output
The switch function is used to turn the game on and off. The LEDs are used to show sound 
levels, and the sound sensor is used to monitor the given amount of noise. Every time a new sound 
level is gauged, a tone will play to signify a new reading.

Game Description
The game is started by turning the switch on. It will delay one second before starting, which 
will be signified by a tone. The tone will play every second to signify a new sound reading. The 
color corelates with the sound level being recognized. The higher/louder the noise, the more points 
the player will be able to get. Once the player gets to 100 points, the game will end
